Over the past few centuries two theoretical frameworks have been 
developed that together most closely resemble a theory of everything 
These two theories upon which all modern physics rests are general relativity
and quantum mechanics General relativity is a theoretical framework 
that only focuses on gravity for understanding the universe in regions of both 
large scale and high mass: planets stars galaxies clusters of galaxies etc 
On the other hand quantum mechanics is a theoretical framework that only focuses
on the three non-gravitational forces for understanding the universe in regions 
of both very small scale and low mass: subatomic particles atoms molecules etc
Quantum mechanics successfully implemented the Standard Model that describes the 
three non-gravitational forces: strong nuclear weak nuclear and electromagnetic 
force â€“ as well as all observed elementary particles
